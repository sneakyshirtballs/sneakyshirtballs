- 👋 Hi, I'm @sneakyshirtballs, and just like Jason from "The Good Place," I'm here to drop some wisdom bombs, or maybe just confuse everyone with my antics. 🤷‍♂️
- 👀 I'm interested in the eternal quest for the perfect burrito, moral philosophy (like Chidi), and finding loopholes in the afterlife point system.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to navigate the complexities of ethics in the digital age, all while avoiding Janet's knowledge glitches.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on a project that explores the ethical implications of using AI to solve life's greatest mysteries – like, "Is pineapple an acceptable pizza topping in the afterlife?"
- 📫 How to reach me... Well, just snap your fingers and summon Janet. If that doesn't work, send me a message on discord; username: **sneakyshirtballs** and hope it reaches the Good Place! 🍤🍹💌
